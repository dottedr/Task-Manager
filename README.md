# Task-Manager
This is beta wersion of simple task management web app. 
It allows to add a task and view conpleted an pending ones. User can also delete a task.
In this project I used jQuery, PHP, SQL and obviously HTML & CSS. 
For database connection I used PDO. 
I played a bit with Ajax to display notifications about changes made and error.

Soon I plan to add:

Add new fields and validate them



Possible changes in the future: 

User could have an account 
and a mobile app
