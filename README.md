# Task-Manager
This is a beta version of a simple task management web app. 
It allows adding a task and view completed and pending ones. A user can also delete a task.
In this project, I used jQuery, PHP, SQL and obviously HTML & CSS. 
For database connection I used PDO. 
I played a bit with Ajax to display notifications about changes made and errors.
